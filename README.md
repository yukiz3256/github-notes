Git( the actual application of the version control) :a piece of software that helps you keep track of your entire history things you wrote/did.It allows many people to work on a project together. 

Github: ( webservice) where you can have an account and do things with git on a website, you can make a project that has the version controls on them. 

Repo: basically a project, theres many files in it. 

Commit: basically meaning save, saving the project. When you commit again, you can add and say what changes you've made. The commits let you see your history, each commit has a unique identifier to it. 


Notes on Github Concept:
Github holds projects aka repo/repositories.
 
Github remote is where your files live, where you are on the web and your repos are public aka an open source. 

Local is where your working on your computer, where your ideas are private. 

Clone: make a copy of entire repo from remote to local

Commit: snapshots of changes

Push: send commits from local to remote

Pull: send commits from remote to local. 

Overall github is great for collaboration, more than one person can work on it without getting interrupted while working on the same file.
